# OC Lua API reference files

These files are specifically generated with OpenOS in mind, but they should still be useful for other development.

# How to use

## No IDE

Open up the file that has what you are interested in, and use it as a reference. Done!

## Intelilj
See Lua for IDEA's documentation: [https://bitbucket.org/sylvanaar2/lua-for-idea/wiki/Setting_Up_Custom_API's](https://bitbucket.org/sylvanaar2/lua-for-idea/wiki/Setting_Up_Custom_API's)

Note that the screenshots are way out of date but otherwise the instructions seem to work

# I don't see the API/Component I want!

Two options here:

* Request it in a [new issue](https://github.com/Pwootage/oc-apis/issues)
* Create it yourself and [open a pull request](https://github.com/Pwootage/oc-apis/pulls)


## Contributing notes

Stick to the same style/format as the rest of the project, please!

When writing a component, [docdump](https://github.com/Pwootage/oc-scripts/blob/master/packages/docdump/docdump.lua) can
generally do most-to-all of the work for you, especially if the mod properly added doc strings.
